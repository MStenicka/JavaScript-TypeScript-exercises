The code is about pirates and their battles.

The Pirate class has the following methods:

- drinkSomeRum() - intoxicates the Pirate by one
- howsItGoingMate() - when called, the Pirate replies:
  - if drinkSomeRun() was called less than 4 times:
    - "Pour me anudder!"
  - else:
    - "Arghh, I'ma Pirate. How d'ya d'ink its goin?". Then the pirate passes out and sleeps it off (gets rid of the intoxication).
- brawl(pirate: Pirate) - where pirate fights another pirate (if both of them are alive):
  - there is 1/3 chance that this dies, the other dies or they both pass out.
- die() - this kills off the pirate. When a pirate is dead, every method simply results in: he's dead.
