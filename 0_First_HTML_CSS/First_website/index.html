      <p>
        I love to design complex systems with high levels of automation
        including AI and robotics. I'm deeply interested in inventing new things
        that can augment the human experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Everything I've done, everything I'll do today, everything I'll ever do,
        I do to protect this world. Someone once told me that with great power
        comes great responsibility.

      <h3>Instruction set</h3>
      <p>
        All computer run using very low-level commands which do some very basic
        functions, such as reading to addresses, and calculating basic
        arithmetic. (The complete list of commands that can be run by a CPU is
        known as that)...

      <h3>Logic gate</h3>
      <p>It is an idealized or physical device implementing a Boolean function; that is, it performs a logical operation on one or more binary inputs and produces a single binary output.</p>
      <h3>ASCII</h3>
      <p>It stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange. Computers can only understand numbers, so it is the numerical representation of a character such as 'a' or '@' or an action of some sort.</p>
      <h3>Random-access memory</h3>
      <p>It is a form of computer data storage which stores frequently used program instructions to increase the general speed of a system. It can be randomly accessed. Data items to be read or written in almost the same amount of time irrespective of the physical location of data inside the memory.</p>
      <h3>Programming language</h3>
      <p>A formal language that specifies a set of instructions that can be used to produce various kinds of output. They generally consist of instructions for a computer and can be used to create programs that implement specific algorithms.
      </p>
      <h3>Domain Name System</h3>
      <p>A hierarchical decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the Internet or a private network. It associates various information with domain names assigned to each of the participating entities.      </p>
      <h3>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</h3>
      <p>An application protocol for distributed, collaborative, and hypermedia information systems. It is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web. It is the standard protocol to exchange or transfer hypertext.      </p>
